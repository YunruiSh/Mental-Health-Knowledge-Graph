I do not view people as sick, dysfunctional, or disordered; rather, I believe that when our desire to grow outweighs our fear of growth, we become empowered to reach our full potential and to live the life that we truly want to live.

It's possible you are struggling to find or maintain healthy relationships, or when you do- find yourself unfulfilled, lonely, or involved in a difficult breakup. Suddenly, feelings of sadness and anxiety are keeping you from being you. It’s hard to know where things keep going wrong and how to move forward with feelings of sadness and anxiety- until now. I help people create opportunities for better relationships with themselves, partners, coworkers, friends and family. Our relationships impact our emotions, motivation, crafts and whole well-being. When we take a curious and nonjudgmental approach, we allow ourselves to slow things down and discover patterns or barriers keeping us from where we’d like to be. Whether it be a relationship, job, life transition, or emotion that is getting in the way of your ideal life, I’d like to work with you to create a space in which you can minimize barriers, accomplish your goals, and gather the insight, tools, and resilience to be able to apply to any obstacles that come your way in life.

I work first with your nervous system's capacity and reconnect your system into its own grounding presence.  I'm specialized in trauma for individuals, couples and/or families. Specialties include PTSD, identity issues, depression, anxiety, military, & grief/bereavement.  Somatic Experiencing (SE), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Mindfulness are how I practice and help you attain health. There is a safe place within you and around you to embrace and hold close regardless of what you have experienced or what you are suffering through.  It is as accessible as your fingertips and the methods I use with you can help you achieve your full, integrated self; mind, heart, body and spirit.  I often share with my clients the potential we have in being fully here, realized and embodied.  We are ALL on a journey, but not a single one of us can do it alone.

My background in the arts, television production, psychology and social work gives me a unique perspective to work with individuals of all ages and backgrounds, to help them conquer their personal demons and live the lives they dream about.

It's from that place of inner safety that we can feel healthy, joyful and bring forth the best parts of ourselves. Are you interested in a cutting edge healing process? To succeed in accessing healing capacities, and to resolve trauma I practice a few different forms of somatic therapy: NeuroAffective Touch, Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy, Somatic Experiencing, and EMDR. Humans have inborn healing capacities that can be accessed through experiences confirming our worth, and by having our needs lovingly met. These needs are meant to be met through tender loving care early in life: a time when we explore the world with our bodies - not our minds.

Visit the PCIT Institute's website today and take our online questionnaire to get insight into your child's behavior and find out if PCIT is right for you and your family! Over 30 published studies have documented the superiority of PCIT over other methods.   Outcome studies have demonstrated important changes in parent-child interactional patterns and have repeatedly shown significant changes with children's behavior problems. After PCIT, children demonstrate significant improvements in compliance and reductions in other disruptive behaviors, such as whining. The effects of PCIT have been shown to generalize to untreated siblings.   Following PCIT, parent study's show an increase in closeness where there are more frequent ""positive talks"" with their child.

                ",Los Angeles,CA,90024,"Have you found yourself not knowing how to navigate a situation and suffering because of that? Have you tried ""everything,"" but are still feeling trapped and immersed in psych suffering, which can manifest itself as isolation, self-criticism, hopelessness, worry, fear, dissatisfaction, interpersonal conflicts, mood changes, dissociation from reality, a sense of being persecuted, and so on?  Have you wondered whether some of the issues you have dealt with - for instance, being incapable of doing things or repeatedly making bad choices - might tell something about your subjective dilemmas? This is the moment to make analysis. My practice is oriented by the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan, who took the steps of Freud. Speaking or playing in the case of children are not only ways of communicating but mostly ways of acting. You say much more than you think, for instance, through dreams and symptoms, and listening to it creates a type of knowledge that mobilizes affects and the body. Throughout this process, you make things happen rather than keep waiting for life to move to accommodate your needs. That happens as you become oriented by your desire, which drives you into action and calls you to take responsibility for those actions. As a result, you will recover the freedom once stolen by the psychic suffering and find new ways of living Você tem tido dificuldade com alguma situação e sofre com isso? Já tentou “tudo”, mas continua se sentindo sem saída e imerso em sofrimento psíquico, o qual pode se manifestar como isolamento, auto-crítica, desesperança, preocupação, medo, insatisfação, conflitos interpessoais, mudanças de humor, dissociação da realidade, sensação de perseguição, etc? Você tem se perguntado se algumas das dificuldades que você tem enfrentado - como, ser incapaz de agir ou repetidamente fazer escolhas erradas - podem dizer algo sobre seus dilemas subjetivos? Essa é a hora de fazer análise.  Minha prática clínica é orientada pela psicanálise de Jacques Lacan, que seguiu os passos de Freud. Falar e brincar no caso das crianças não são apenas modos de se comunicar, mas principalmente modos de agir. Você fala muito mais do que supõe, por exemplo, através de sonhos e sintomas, e escutar isso cria um tipo de saber que mobiliza os afetos e o corpo.   Neste processo, você passa a agir em vez de continuar esperando que as coisas mudem na direção desejada. Isso acontece porque você passa a se orientar pelo seu desejo, o qual te dirige a agir e te chama a assumir a responsabilidade por essas ações. Como resultado, você vai recuperar a liberdade roubada pelo sofrimento psíquico e criar novos modos de viver.",,[],"['ADHD', 'Addiction', 'Adoption', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Issues', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Borderline Personality (BPD)', 'Child', 'Chronic Impulsivity', 'Codependency', 'Coping Skills', 'Depression', 'Developmental Disorders', 'Divorce', 'Domestic Abuse', 'Education and Learning Disabilities', 'Emotional Disturbance', 'Family Conflict', 'Grief', 'Infidelity', 'Life Transitions', 'Marital and Premarital', 'Narcissistic Personality (NPD)', 'Obsessive-Compulsive (OCD)', 'Oppositional Defiance (ODD)', 'Parenting', 'Peer Relationships', 'Pregnancy, Prenatal, Postpartum', 'Relationship Issues', 'School Issues', 'Self Esteem', 'Self-Harming', 'Sexual Abuse', 'Stress', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Trauma and PTSD']","['Dissociative Disorders (DID)', 'Impulse Control Disorders', 'Mood Disorders', 'Personality Disorders', 'Psychosis', 'Thinking Disorders']", Ethnicity:  Hispanic and Latino ,"['Adults', 'Teen', 'Preteen', 'Children (6 to 10)', 'Toddler']",[],"['Clinical Supervision and Licensed Supervisors', 'Play Therapy', 'Psychoanalytic', 'Psychodynamic']","['Individuals', 'Family']"

But if you don't live in a way that truly suits you, something inside leaves, all of your relationships suffer and, in a way, you die . . . until you learn what lights your eyes and find ways to achieve it. My sessions highlight collaboration and finding ""you.""  Without the real you, nothing else matters.

The therapeutic relationship we develop will allow us to work collaboratively  to find solutions and answers together.  The more committed you are, the more change you will experience. Unlike brief quick ""cure"" therapies focusing on single problems or symptoms, psychoanalysis considers you a whole person, slowly integrating all aspects of your mind/brain/body.  Linking your inner and outer worlds, your dreams, wishes, desires, fears, losses, past and present, your life begins to change gently and meaningfully. People often begin psychoanalytic therapy after feeling disappointed by other forms of treatment that attempt to control thoughts and behaviors. 

Psychoanalysis safely explores unconscious emotional patterns - ""maps"" driving your thoughts, beliefs and behaviors - by bringing into awareness these echoes from infancy before thinking matured.

On the inside, you probably feel dread in the pit of your  stomach as a constant reminder that something bad could happen at a moment's notice. This makes it very hard to concentrate or to let your guard down. Constant worry or intrusive thoughts leave you feeling exhausted and irritable. An unspoken consequence of your anxiety is a defeating sense of shame, leading you to feel weak or small. You long for a state of peace and comfort that you may not have known for years, or maybe since you were a small child.

DBT began as the premiere treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder and then grew to be successful for treating a multitude of issues, including depression, anxiety, mood swings, and a variety of addictions.  DBT is evidenced based (that means researched intensively and approved by science).  DBT is provided through individual therapy and skills groups.

I teamed up with a colleague, Katharina Kienböck, to work with couples and families. Couples and families tend to come to us when they feel a strong rift in their relationship, often struggling with anger and blame, conflict and distance. By directing the conversation in a structured way, we create a safe environment that allows for space from these problems and brings strengths and resources to the foreground that may have been eclipsed. Collaboratively, we re-invite understanding, appreciation, and fun, and encourage our clients to re-join as a team and to create a path toward connection, trust, and resilience. We are honored to be part of our couples’ journeys to more fulfilling relationships.",,[],"['Adoption', 'Anxiety', 'Coping Skills', 'Depression', 'Divorce', 'Family Conflict', 'Grief', 'Infidelity', 'Life Coaching', 'Life Transitions', 'Marital and Premarital', 'Parenting', 'Peer Relationships', 'Relationship Issues', 'Self Esteem', 'Sleep or Insomnia', 'Stress']",[],,[],[],"['Cognitive Behavioral (CBT)', 'Culturally Sensitive', 'Family / Marital', 'Narrative', 'Relational', 'Solution Focused Brief (SFBT)', 'Strength-Based']","['Individuals', 'Couples', 'Family']"

Depth Psychotherapy rests on the premise that there is a natural, self regulating urge of the psyche which seeks its own wholeness. This natural propensity towards wholeness emerges out of the archetypes, universally inherited potentialities that express and maintain all that is uniquely human.    In a Depth Psychotherapy experience, exploration of the unconscious dimensions of one's being promotes access to the creative archetypal potentials which activate authentic healing. My specialty is grounded in a Depth Psychological model of treatment. The Depth therapy process, as an honoring of soul, respects behavior, intellect, body, emotion, dreams, intuition, imagination and fantasy. The therapeutic alliance between client and therapist attends to the spontaneously emerging unconscious energies which enrich the therapeutic process.

You are feeling overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, looking for guidance to provide relief. You're tired of managing this on your own, or with support that hasn't been quite the right fit for your needs. My goal is to help you understand and manage your anxiety, stress, insomnia, relationship stress, mood changes (or all of these), so that you can thrive. You are here because you are ready! Let's discuss your goals so we can take proactive steps together towards positive change. Maintaining mental health requires conscious effort and investment, similar to maintaining physical health. You may be more reluctant to tend to your mental health needs. Treating both the mind and body is an integral part of overall wellbeing, so give yourself permission to take good care of yourself and seek support through therapy. All sessions are currently online. This means starting therapy right now is very easy and convenient. I invite you to schedule an initial consultation to discuss your goals and find out more about how I can help. I’m excited to connect with you!

Perhaps you know what is causing these feelings or maybe it feels like they came out of nowhere.  Either way, these feelings overwhelm you and you’re just not sure what to do about it anymore. You notice that your relationships, work and even your ability to care for yourself are starting to be affected. You make plans to work out or make a positive change, but quickly give up because you just don’t have the energy. You are starting to lose hope that you can get yourself out of this. But the good news is there is hope.  You don’t need to sit with these feelings alone.

I graduated from the University of Southern California. I have worked in a wide range of areas. I have helped client’s manage and cope with challenging health and emotional issues, as well as life transitions, substance abuse, and relationship problems. As your counselor, I can help you explore, process, and learn ways to cope with life challenges. I have learned that when people feel alone and confused they need a therapist that will actively listen without passing judgment, and give them a space where they feel safe to share their experiences and reflect on them. I have an eclectic approach. My theoretical foundations are psychodynamic, humanistic and cognitive-behavioral. I can teach you techniques to help you cope and work through the feelings that are bringing you to counseling. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with you.

Cada persona tiene sus momentos en la vida en los que siente que ""algo no está bien"". Estos momentos vienen por muchas razones: pérdida, cambio, acumulación de luchas entre nosotros o los demás, patrones de relación que no podemos cambiar aunque lo intentemos, trauma o una infancia difícil, soledad, miedo, sentimientos de tristeza, ansiedad o inquietud, etc. En estos momentos buscamos la claridad, el sentimiento o la nueva dirección que necesitamos, o simplemente una forma de manejar bien nuestras emociones y comportamientos que están impactando nuestra vida y la vida de los demás. Estoy capacitada y experimentada en varias terapias basadas en evidencia, que adapto al viaje personal de cada cliente. Estos incluyen terapia cognitivo-conductual, enfoques psicodinámicos, enfoques psicoanalíticos de Jung, enfoques del sistema familiar, teoría del apego, terapia centrada en las emociones y terapia cognitiva basada en mindfulness. Como terapeuta licenciada, me esfuerzo por combinar mis habilidades, experiencia y calidez hacia la sanación y la plenitud de mis clientes.

It's hard to stay positive when the triggering constantly leads to predictable behavior that leads to predictable, hurtful results. My general practice includes counseling where finances are a significant trigger for self criticism or conflict in a relationship; also in families where either silence/withdrawal on the one hand or conflict on the other eat away at the fiber of the household or family business.

I strongly believe each child’s needs are unique. What works for one child or family, doesn't necessarily work for the next. Some children’s behaviors are more difficult to understand. Some children feel deeply in ways that their peers do not. I’m here to offer you a non-judgmental space to explore the current dynamics of your family and explore which changes can help create a more harmonious and enjoyable household.   Play is the avenue through which children learn. I use play activities to facilitate new experiences of connection and understanding between you and your child. Through play, we will explore what techniques help your child feel emotionally regulated. I will also offer support to you in managing the inevitable stress of being a parent. While I enjoy working with children of all ages, I specialize in working with young children (3-7) and their parents.

Therapy is a healing process that happens  through our shared connection and your expanding awareness. It requires a safe place, where truth is expressed and pain is transformed. Typically we meet suffering with distractions, intoxication or denial. When we find a way to experience emotional sobriety, our relationships with ourselves and others can heal.

Do you find it difficult to communicate freely and feel disconnected, unheard, or unsafe? Perhaps anxiety or past trauma is burdening you from living a full life. It is my mission to create a safe space for my clients to heal and grow, affirm what works for them, and encourage personal freedom. As a licensed Clinical Social Worker, I am committed to helping individuals, couples, and families build and maintain healthier relationships, as well as supporting and encouraging growth and confidence. My therapeutic approach draws from cognitive behavioral therapy, gender-affirming therapy, and I have worked in community mental health for over 8 years. I have specialized training in trauma practice, particularly around experiences of abuse, violence, and intergenerational trauma. I see adults, couples, and families in our practice. Identifying as a Queer Latina Woman and being a First Generation American of immigrant parents, I deeply understand the importance of finding a therapist who recognizes the intersectionality of the diverse populations of Los Angeles.
