Zopiclone is a sleeping pill that belongs to a group of drugs called non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. It has a different structure to benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, such as Halcion (triazolam), but has similar benefits and side effects. Zopiclone helps to reduce the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep (sleep latency), increase the amount of time you sleep for (sleep duration), and decrease the number of times you wake up at night (nocturnal awakenings). Zopiclone starts to work quickly, taking about an hour to work. Zopiclone works by binding to a receptor in your brain called the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor and enhancing the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chemical messenger that has a calming effect. Zopiclone became available in the 1980s and is approved for use in many parts of the world. However, it is not available in the US where it is a schedule IV controlled substance. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved eszopiclone (Lunesta). Eszopiclone is a stereoisomer of zopiclone, which means it is made up of the same parts connected in the same sequences, but its 3D structure is different. Zopiclone usually comes as a tablet. In some countries, your doctor may be able to order you an oral solution containing this medication if you have trouble swallowing. Branded and generic versions of zopiclone are available.

Melatonin is also made synthetically and available without a prescription as an over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement in the U.S. Melatonin is most commonly used to: The wake-sleep cycle is the process of sleep and wakefulness; in humans this averages 8 hours of nighttime sleep and 16 hours of daytime activity. Supplemental Melatonin has been suggested to have many uses, from sleep disorders to cancer treatment, but adequate studies are lacking for many uses. It has been widely studied for treatment of jet lag and other sleep disorders. Endogenous melatonin release (made by our bodies) is increased each day in response to darkness, peaking between 11PM and 3AM at roughly 200 picograms (pg) per mL. Nighttime levels are roughly 10 times higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, known as our circadian rhythm. Natural melatonin production starts from the amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin as an intermediary, and then is released to the receptors in the brain, eye and other areas to help control the sleep quality and wake cycles. The half-life is short, roughly 20 to 50 minutes. It is metabolized (broken down) by the CYP450 enzyme system in the liver and then excreted in the urine or feces. Shorter periods of production occur in the summer with longer days, and more prolonged periods of production occur in the winter. Light at night (such as from smartphones or the TV) blocks production and can lead to sleep disturbances. Age also suppresses the levels of nighttime melatonin that are released, which may contribute to the problem of insomnia and early awakening often seen in older adults.

Naltrexone also modifies how the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal gland (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, HPA axis) interact to suppress the amount of alcohol consumed. Naltrexone comes as an extended-release intramuscular injection (Vivitrol) and as oral tablets. The branded versions of naltrexone tablets (Revia, Depade) have been discontinued, but generic versions are available. Naltrexone tablets were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1984. In 2006, the FDA also approved Vivitrol, the extended-release intramuscular injection form of naltrexone.	"Naltrexone can cause serious side effects, including: 1. Risk of opioid overdose. You can accidentally overdose in two ways. 2. Severe reactions at the site of the naltrexone injection (injection site reactions). Some people have had severe injection site reactions, including tissue death (necrosis), while receiving naltrexone injections. Some of these injection site reactions have required surgery. This medication must be injected by a healthcare provider. Call your healthcare provider right away if you notice any of the following at any of your injection sites: Tell your healthcare provider about any reaction at an injection site that concerns you, gets worse over time, or does not get better by two weeks after the injection. 3. Sudden opioid withdrawal. Anyone who receives naltrexone must not use any type of opioid (must be opioid-free) including street drugs, prescription pain medicines, cough, cold, or diarrhea medicines that contain opioids, or opioid dependence treatments, buprenorphine or methadone, for at least 7 to 14 days before starting this medication. Using opioids in the 7 to 14 days before you start receiving treatment may cause you to suddenly have symptoms of opioid withdrawal when you receive treatment. Sudden opioid withdrawal can be severe, and you may need to go to the hospital. You must be opioid-free before receiving naltrexone unless your healthcare provider decides that you don't need to go through detox first. Instead, your doctor may decide to give this medication in a medical facility that can treat you for sudden opioid withdrawal. 4. Liver damage or hepatitis. Naltrexone can cause liver damage or hepatitis. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms of liver problems during treatment with this medication: Your healthcare provider may need to stop treating you with this medication if you get signs or symptoms of a serious liver problem. You must inform every doctor that treats you that you are taking Naltrexone. Non-opiate based anesthetics should be used if you require an anesthetic in an emergency situation. If you have to use opiate containing anesthetics, you may need higher doses than usual. You may also be more sensitive to the side-effects (breathing difficulties and circulatory problems)."

Quetiapine was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997. Generic and branded versions of the drug are available in tablet and extended-release tablet form.	Quetiapine may cause serious side effects, including: 1. risk of death in the elderly with dementia.
